### Additional Characters

In the Chuvash keyboard for Mac OS we have added additional characters: the old Chuvash characters, and characters used to write
other languages of the Russian Federation. 
If you need to type in Russian, Chuvash, Tatar, or, say, Udmurt, you can find more detailed information at the
[Keyboard Layout for Mac OS Project Page](https://github.com/mirontoli/chuvash-kbd/tree/master/Mac). 

## Web
If you are using another person's computer, or you don't have permission to install programs on your computer 
(for example, at work), you can use our virtual keyboard in your browser. 
Go to [chuvashskaya.klaviatura.su](http://bit.ly/cv-kbd-web), type what you need to type, and then copy and paste it elsewhere.
